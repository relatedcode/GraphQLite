## GraphQL API

GraphQLite is an open-source GraphQL server, using the latest technologies. Queries, Mutations, and event-based (Pub/Sub) Subscriptions.

## Schema Generator

With our easy-to-use schema generator, the Database tables, the GraphQL schema, and all the resolvers are created automatically.

## Database

GraphQLite is a perfect match for developers who are looking to get the most out of PostgreSQL. It takes the best features of PostgreSQL and wraps it in an API that's easy to use.

## User Auth

With the industry-standard JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication, GraphQLite is a security layer for your API, providing a way to authenticate and authorize any request.

## File Storage

With an S3 API compatible File Storage, GraphQLite gives you instant access to your files. High performance and unlimited flexibility delivered with your Core Server.

## Powerful SDKs

You can build Swift apps quickly by using the native [iOS SDK](https://graphqlite.com/sdk-ios). With our [npm library](https://graphqlite.com/sdk-web), Web development has never been easier. Flutter SDK is also coming soon.

## Studio Apps

Download our native [Studio Mac app](https://apps.apple.com/app/graphqlite-studio/id1601080565), or use it anywhere from [your browser](https://graphqlite.com/studio-web). Multi-user environment, one-click test server deployment, and public API templates.

## Demo Projects

You can test all the features, by installing our nicely designed, fully functional, [RelatedChat](https://github.com/relatedcode/RelatedChat) web app. Also, the Studio apps are based on the latest GraphQLite technology.
